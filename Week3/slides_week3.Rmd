## Recall From Last Week... | Scaled Residual Deviance

$$\hat{D}* = \frac{2( l(\tilde{\mu}; y, \phi) - l(\hat{\mu}; y, \phi))}{\phi}$$

$$\hat{D}* = -\frac{2}{\phi} log \left( \frac{L(\hat{\mu}; y, \phi)}{L(\tilde{\mu}; y, \phi)}\right)$$

## Making it concrete | Normal Example

For 


##Recall from last week | A general linear model {.codefont}
```{r, echo=FALSE}
normal_glm_fit <- glm(data = mtcars,
   formula = mpg ~ cyl + wt + am,
   family = gaussian(link="identity") )


#We also tried     

# Observations
# Dispersion = rse from lm ^2
# Null deviance = total sum of squares
# Residual deviance = sum of squared residuals
```
